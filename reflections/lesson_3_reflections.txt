When would you want to create a reomte respository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working as part of a team and when working from differents pc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rahter than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
Because I need to be sure that the changes introduced 
are important enough tu make a new commit.
