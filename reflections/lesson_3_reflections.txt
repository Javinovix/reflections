When would you want to create a reomte respository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
When working as part of a team and when working from differents pc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rahter than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
Because I need to be sure that the changes introduced 
are important enough tu make a new commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is an exact coppy of a repository
this copy can be modified in any way. This
is usually used when you want to collaborate
in a project and have the authorization to do so.

A branch is a way to split a repository in order
to have a way to modify the behavior of a program
without affecting the official version of it. This
is usually used to test experimental changes.

A fork is a way to clone someone else's repository
through GitHub. This is usually done when someone
wants to work in a specific project but does not
have permission to modify the repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known
state of the remote stored locally?
It allows the user to have an up-to-date copy of 
the files within the remote branches, so in case
the user is offline he/she can work with the last
version available.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier and what would be harder?
I would use a cloud drive like Dropbox, Onedrive or
Google drive.
It would be easier to setup, but it would be harder
to track and syn changes, especially when 2 or more
people work in the same file at the same time.
